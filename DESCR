Jira collects and maintains all kinds of useful data about your
workflow. Unfortunately it does a horrible job of exposing that in any
meaningful way. This project addresses that gap by giving you a way to
pull that data out of Jira and either dumping it into CSV files that
you can then manipulate yourself or by creating an HTML report with
key findings.
